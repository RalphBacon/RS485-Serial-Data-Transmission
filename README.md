If data transmission via radio waves is not for you (see video #73 on the nRF24L01+ modules) then maybe good old 2-wire transmission using the RS485 interface is a better choice.

The modules are to be had for pennies, the coding is simple and no libraries are required although we do use the SerialSoftware library to create a new serial port on arbitrary GPIO pins - not needed if you have a Mega 2560 as that four hardware serial ports built right into the hardware.

Data transmission speed can be quite high (115200 bps) and distances quite long (1.2km) but not both at the same time!

All in all, this can be a solution for outlying buildings, sheds, barns and the like as long as they have power.

As a bonus, you get first look at my new blog which I'm going to use to fill the gaps between videos. Yes, I know, I'm spoiling you. But be kind and bear with me - it's early days yet and the paint is not yet quite dry (or finished).

All code can be found in my Github:
